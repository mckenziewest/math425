Let $R=\{f:\R\to\R\ | f\text{ is a continuous function}\}$. For $f,g\in R$, define $f+g$ and $fg$ pointwise as the functions $f+g:\R\to \R$ and $fg:\R\to\R$ defined by $(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)$ and $(fg)(x)=f(x)g(x)$. Then $R$ is a ring with these operations.  

Each of the following questions refer to this ring. You must provide explanation for your answers.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Is $R$ a commutative ring?\vfill
	\item What is the additive identity of $R$?\vfill
	\item What is the multiplicative identity of $R$?\vfill
	\item What are the zero divisors of $R$?  \vfill
	\item What are the multiplicative units in $R$?\vfill
	\item Find an element $f\in R$ that is neither $0_R$ nor $1_R$ that satisfies $f^2=f$.\vfill

Let $R=\Z_4\times \Z_8$. For $(a,b),(c,d)\in R$, define $(a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)$ and $(a,b)(c,d)=(ac,bd)$. Then $R$ is a ring with these operations.
