\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}

%%

Show that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ using Theorem 2.3.1.
	
\[H=\left\{\left.\begin{bmatrix}a&0&0\\0&b&0\\0&0&c\end{bmatrix}\right| a,b,c\in\R\right\}; G = M_3(\R).\]

Note: Here $M_3(\R)$ is the group of $3\times 3$ matrices with the operation of addition.
	
%%

Let $G=S_\R=\{\phi:\R\to\R\ |\ \phi\text{ is a bijection}\}$, this is a group under composition.
	
Let $H=\{\text{linear functions}\}=\{\tau:\R\to\R\ |\ \tau(x)=ax+b\ \exists a,b\in\R\ \forall x\in \R\}$. Show that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ using Theorem 2.3.1. 

(This is also exercise 18 of section 2.3 if you want to see it stated in a slightly different way.)

%%

Let $G$ be a group and $a,b\in G$ some fixed elements. Assume $ab=ba$. Let $H=\{g\in G\ |\ agb=bga\}$. Show that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ using Theorem 2.3.1.

Let $G$ be a group and let $D = \{(g,g)\in G\times G\ |\ g\in G\}$ be a subset of $G\times G$. Show that $D$ is a subgroup of $G\times G$ using Theorem 2.3.1.

%%

Let $n\geq 2$ be an integer, and let $G=S_n$.  Set $H=\{\sigma\in S_n\ |\ \sigma(1)=1\}$. Show that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ using Theorem 2.3.1.
