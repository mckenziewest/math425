Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets with a mapping $\alpha\colon A\to B$. Assume that there is some map $\beta:B\to A$ such that $\alpha\beta=1_B$. Prove that $\alpha$ is onto.

Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets with a mapping $\alpha\colon A\to B$. Assume that there is some map $\beta:B\to A$ such that $\beta\alpha=1_A$. Prove that $\alpha$ is one-to-one.

Let $A=\left\{\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}\ |\ a,b,c,d\in\R\right\}$. Define $\phi\colon \C\to A$ by $$\phi(a+bi)=\begin{bmatrix}a+bi&0\\0&a-bi\end{bmatrix}.$$ Prove that $\phi$ is one-to-one but not onto.

Let $A$ be a non-empty set. Define $\sigma:A\to A\times A$ by $\sigma(a)=(a,a)$. Is $\sigma$ one-to-one? onto? a bijection? You must prove each of your answers.
