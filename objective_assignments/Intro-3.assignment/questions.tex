Let $\sim$ on $\Z$ be defined by $a\sim b$ if and only if $a^2-b^2$ is divisible by 4. Prove that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation and describe the set of unique equivalence classes.

Let $S=\{(a,b)\in\Z\times\Z\ |\ b\neq 0\}$ Let $\equiv$ be the relation on $S$ defined by $(a,b)\equiv (c,d)$ if $ad=bc$. Prove that $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation and describe the set of unique equivalence classes.

Let $A$ be the set of all people in the world. We define the relation $\sim$ on $A$ by $a\sim b$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ were born in the same month of the year.  Prove that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation and describe the set of unique equivalence classes.

Let $\mathcal{L}=\{a+bx\ |\ a,b\in\R\}$ be the set of linear and constant polynomials over $\R$. You can also think of $\mathcal{L}$ as the set of all lines in $\R^2$.  For $\ell_1,\ell_2\in \mathcal{L}$ we will say $\ell_1\equiv \ell_2$ if $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ have the same slope.  Prove that $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation and describe the set of unique equivalence classes.

Let $\sim$ on $\Q$ be defined by $a\sim b$ if and only if $a-b\in\Z$. Prove that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation and describe the set of unique equivalence classes.
