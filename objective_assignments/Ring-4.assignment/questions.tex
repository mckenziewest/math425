Let $R,S$ be rings and $T=R\times S$.  Let $\bar S=\{(0,s) \ |\ s\in S\}$.
		Use the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings to show that $\bar S$ is an ideal of $T$ and $T/\bar S\cong R$.

If $p$ is prime, let $\Z_{(p)}=\{\frac{n}{m}\in \Q\ |\ p\text{ does not divide }m\}$.  This is a subring of $\Q$.  Let $J=\{\frac{n}{m}\in \Z_{(p)}\ |\ p\text{ divides }n\}$.  Use the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings to show that $J$ is an ideal of $\Z_{(p)}$ and $\Z_{(p)}/J\cong \Z_p$.
