Let $n\geq 3$. Show that $|\Z_n^\times|$ is even.
	
%%

Let $G$ be a group of order $n$ and let $m$ be an integer with $\gcd(m,n)=1$.  If $g\in G$ satisfies $g^m=1$, show that $g=1$.

%%

Let $p$ be a prime number and $G$ a group of order $p^3$.  Prove that if $G$ is not cyclic, then $g^{p^2}=1$ for all $g\in G$.
	
%%

Let $G$ be a group with elements $a,b\in G$.  Assume $a^k=b^k$.  Write $m=o(a)$ and $n=o(b)$.  Show that if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime then $mn$ divides $k$.

%%

If $G$ is a group of order $p^k$ where $p$ is some prime and $k\geq 1$.  Show that $G$ must have an element of order $p$.
