If you are submitting a paper as one of your major artifacts, you will submit a 3-5 page typed pdf document in the style of one of the sections from our textbook.

What follows describes the components I expect. The scores listed are guidelines and adjustments will be made for partial credit between the listed values.

    <b>Introduction</b>
    <br>Description of how this section of the textbook that you're writing sits in the context of Math 425. Briefly describe in a few sentences how this relates to other topics we have learned this semester.
    <br>
    You want your introduction to capture the attention of the reader in some way. Why would they want to read your section?
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>5pts: The context of the section is clear, and there is a hook to keep the reader's attention.</li>
      <li>3pts: The context is clear but there is no hook for the reade.</li>
      <li>1pt: The introduction lacks context.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Examples</b>
    <br>
    Each definition and theorem must be accompanied by 1-2 examples to illustrate their meaning.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>6pts: Every definition and theorem includes 1-2 examples that illustrate their idea and purpose.</li>
      <li>3pts: Some of the examples lack context or are redundant.</li>
      <li>1pt: Illustrative examples are missing.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>6</td>

<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Definitions</b>
    <br>
    You are expected to include any definitions that we have not covered in class. 
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>8pts: All items that were not defined in class have clear definitions and those definitions are correct.</li>
      <li>4pts: There is a term that should be defined but is not.</li>
      <li>1pt: There are definitions that are not mentioned.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>8</td>

<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Theorem</b>
    <br>
    Your textbook section must include at least one major theorem on the topic.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>8pts: The theorem is stated in generality, it is clear how the theorem fits with the surrounding narrative, and the reader is ready to apply the Theorem to examples.</li>
      <li>4pts: The theorem is not precise or lacks context/relation.</li>
      <li>1pt: The theorem is stated incorrectly or vaguely.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>8</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Proof</b>
    <br>
    Your textbook section must include at least one proof. This proof must be in your own words, but does not need to be a proof of something new. Your proof can be of a theorem or using a theorem on an example. The proof must be substantial in that it illustrates a new technique or approach to the reader. (If you're curious, you can ask if your proof satisfies this criteria.)
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>8pts: The proof is well-written and persuasive, it references any necessary results and invites the reader to apply it in similar examples. The proof would have been difficult for the reader to come up with on their own, but can, after reading, be applied to other, similar, statements. The proof is not a direct copy from another source.</li>
      <li>4pts: The proof satisfies most of the requirements for 5pts but not all.</li>
      <li>1pt: The proof is a copy from another source and does not match the content of your work.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>

  <td>
    <b>Connecting Narrative/Structure</b>
    <br>
    Your document should be a readable document that flows from one point to the next, rather than a disjoint collection of pieces of information.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>5pts: Section and subsection titles are used to arrange the content by theme. There is narrative between the definitions, examples, and theorems that helps the reader understand their relationship.</li>
      <li>3pts: Content is not explicitly arranged by theme,  but the reader can find themes if they look.</li>
      <li>1pt: Content is not arranged in a way that they reader sees the story of the section.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>

<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Typesetting</b>
    <br>
    This is the expectation that your writing is typeset using either LaTeX or equation editing tools in a word processor.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>5pts: Mathematical components are properly typeset, the spacing is consistent, and the section looks clean.</li>
      <li>3pts: Most but not all mathematics is properly typeset, but the narrative is well-spaced and looks organized.</li>
      <li>1pt: Little care was put into properly typesetting the document.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>5</td>

<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Grammar</b>
    <br>
    You are expected to use proper English grammar. This includes correct punctuation, spelling, and sentence structure.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>5pts: Full sentences are used and no improper math slang is included. Care is given to spelling words correctly and proper punctuation.</li>
      <li>3pts: Full sentences are used and no improper math slang is included. Some spelling and punctuation errors exist.</li>
      <li>1pt: Sentence structure is used in most places but not all. Some spelling and punctuation errors exist.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Differentiation</b>
    <br>
    Take the time and effort to include various ways to think about/approach a topic.  This might mean you include some narrative around a definition to "say it in plain English" or provide a second example, illustrating a topic in a different way.  (Ex. verbal vs visual descriptions)
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>2pts: A variety of examples are provided to help various different learners interact with the content.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Exercises</b>
    <br>
    At the end of your written textbook section I expect you to include several exercises that a reader could complete after reading your section.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>5pts: There are 5 thoughtful exercises that allow the reader to interact with the content. These exercises are not direct copies from another resource, though they may be directly inspired by other resources.
      </li>
      <li>3pts: There are 3 exercises that allow the reader to interact with the content.</li>
      <li>1pt: There is one exercise.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Citations</b>
    <br>
    All resources are properly cited. You must use a consistent citation style that would allow a reader to find the source on their own.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>3pts: Sources are cited and formatting of sources is consistent for them all.</li>
      <li>1pt: Sources are cited but formatting differs between them.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>3</td>
