If you are submitting a video as one of your major artifacts, you will both a video recording and the slides or notes you used.
<br><br>
The audience for the video is something you will choose and make clear in the components below.
<br><br>
What follows describes the components I expect between your video and slides. The scores listed are guidelines and adjustments will be made for partial credit between the listed values.

  <td>
    <b>Contextualization</b>
    <br>Description of how the presented information sits in the context of Math 425, as related to the specific audience.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>10pts: Sufficient time is spent informing the audience about how the content of the video relates to the topics covered in Math 425, at a level relevant to the audience.</li>
      <li>8pts: The context can be easily inferred by the viewer but might not be fully explicit.</li>
      <li>4pts: The relationship of the video content to Math 425 requires interpretation.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Essential Question(s)</b>
    <br>
    What will the viewers be able to answer by the end of the video?  Directly share this desired outcome with the viewer and make sure that by the end they can answer it. Be sure to restate the outcomes as a summary at the end of the video. Also be sure that the questions are presented at a level appropriate to the audience.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>5pts: The questions relate directly to the content of the video and the viewer will know exactly how to answer it. </li>
      <li>4pts: The questions relate directly to the content of the video and the viewer will, with a bit of thought on their own, know how to answer it.</li>
      <li>2pts: The questions relate tangentially to the content of the video and partial answers may be able to be inferred.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Hook</b>
    <br>
    What will you use to catch the audience's interests? 
    This could be an interesting example, a connection to past content, or whatever you think will be interesting enough to motivate the viewer to keep watching.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>3pts: The introduction has an attention grabbing example or narrative that will keep the viewer watching.</li>
      <li>1pts: The topic is introduced but there isn't a particular hook.
    </ul>
  </td>

  <td>
    <b>Resources</b>
    <br>
    Provide ways for a viewer to explore the topic of the video on their own. A slide with resources at the end of the presentation will be sufficient for this component.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>4pts: There are 4 ways for the viewer to explore the topic at a level appropriate to the audience.</li>
      <li>2pts: There are 2 ways for the viewer to explore the topic.</li>

    <b>Explain</b>
    <br>
    This section will include the mathematical content of your video. A majority of this content should appear both written visually on screen (typed or scribed) and it should also be stated out loud by you, the presenter. Note that what you say out loud can differ from what is written on screen. Your video must include all of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>precise definitions;</li>
        <li>two illustrative examples per definition;</li>
        <li>at least one theorem relevant to the topic;</li>
        <li>at least one proof of a theorem.</li>
      </ul>
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>25pts: All necessary content is given in detail, so the viewer can understand at the level they are expected to.</li>
      <li>20pts: All necessary content is given. One or two components might not have sufficient detail.</li>
      <li>15pts: All but one of the 4 listed necessary content are given with some detail, but maybe not a sufficient amount of detail</li>
      <li>5pts: There's a start for at least 2 of the list necessary content, but it would be hard to lecture on the content.</li>
    </ul>

  <td>
    <b>Presentation Quality</b>
    <br>
    Your final presentation is practiced and precise. It fits into the 10-15 minute window. The audio is clear.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>7pts: The presentation is practiced, appropriate length, and easy to watch.</li>
      <li>5pts: The presentation is practiced, but the length does not match the 10-15 minute requirement.</li>
      <li>2pts: Parts of the presentation show clear lack of practice and knowledge of the material.</li>
    </ul>

  <td>
    <b>Visuals</b>
    <br>
    Your slides or written work is easy to read. Colors are used appropriately, and consideration is taken for visually impaired audience members.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>6pts: The slides are not over-cluttered with text. Images are not blurry. Colors contrast appropriately. Narrative is given to aid viewers who are visually impaired in their understanding of the content.</li>
      <li>4pts: The slides are not over-cluttered with text. Images are not blurry.</li>
      <li>2pts: Some slides are hard to follow because their is either too much text or the content is hard to read.</li>
