If you are submitting a video as one of your major artifacts, you will both a video recording and the slides or notes you used.
<br><br>
The audience for the video is something you will choose and make clear in the components below.
<br><br>
What follows describes the components I expect between your video and slides. The scores listed are guidelines and adjustments will be made for partial credit between the listed values.

    <b>Contextualization</b>
    <br>Description of how this lesson sits in the context of Math 425, and a description of the audience for the lesson. A timeline for how long you would expect to spend on this content.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>10pts: The audience is well-defined and the context listed is relevant to that audience and relevant to what we have discussed in Math 425. The expected amount of time to complete the content is stated.</li>
      <li>8pts: The audience is well-defined and the relevance of the context can be easily explained by the instructor.</li>
      <li>4pts: The context for the lesson is loosely written and its relationship to Math 425 requires interpretation.</li>

    <b>Essential Question(s)</b>
    <br>
    What question(s) will the students be answering with this lesson? How do those questions relate to the contextualization?
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>5pts: The questions relate directly to the contextualization for the topic and the students will see how they fit.</li>
      <li>4pts: The questions relate directly to the contextualization for the topic and after some the instructor explains, the students will see how they fit.</li>
      <li>2pts: The questions relate tangentially to the contextualization for the topic and after the instructor explains, the students will see how they fit.</li>

    <b>Hook</b>
    <br>
    What will you use to catch the students' interests? 
    This could be an interesting example, a connection to past content, or whatever you think will be interesting enough to motivate the students to learn the content.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>3pts: The introduction has an attention grabbing method that relates the topic to the students' experience.  For example, if the audience is math 425, then there is a description of the way you will relate this to the course.</li>
      <li>1pts: The topic is introduced but there isn't a particular hook.
    </ul>

    <b>Exploration</b>

    Provide ways for a student to explore the topic of the lesson. This may include a link to an article, a reference to our textbook, a link to a YouTube video, a podcast, etc.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>4pts: There are 4 ways for the student to explore the topic.</li>

    <b>Explain</b>
    <br>
    This section will include content of your instruction for this section. This should include notes you could use to either lecture from or generate a handout on the content that the students would complete during a class time. This section of your lesson plan must include all of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>precise definitions;</li>
        <li>two illustrative examples per definition;</li>
        <li>at least one theorem relevant to the topic;</li>
        <li>at least one proof of a theorem that you are ready to present. Note that I expect you to have notes within the proof about how you would explain it.</li>
      </ul>
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>20pts: All necessary content is given in detail, so that an instructor could use them as class notes.</li>
      <li>15pts: All necessary content is given. One or two components might not have sufficient detail.</li>
      <li>10pts: All but one of the 4 listed necessary content are given with some detail, but maybe not a sufficient amount of detail</li>
      <li>5pts: There's a start for at least 2 of the list necessary content, but it would be hard to lecture on the content.</li>

    <b>Assessment</b>
    <br>
    Create an assessment for students to apply what they learn. The assessment should be used by the teacher to evaluate a studentâ€™s understanding of the content. This may be as straight forward as a list of exercises or as complicated as a project.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>6pts: The assignment has clear directions and at least one template or description of the artifact the student needs to create.
      </li>
      <li>4pts: The assignment has somewhat directions, however the assignment might be difficult to complete due to limited instructions.
      </li>
      <li>2pts: The assignment has a vague description.
      </li>
