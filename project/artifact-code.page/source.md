If you are submitting a code as one of your major artifacts, you will submit both the code you produce and the description of how to use the code and what the code does. 
<br><br>
My primary experience is with Python and Sage. My preference would be for you to use a Jupyter Notebook, <a href="https://jupyter.org/try">learn more here</a>. The language you use is not restricted to Python however, what you do use must be easily obtainable so that I can run your code on my computer.
<br><br>
The primary advantage of using a Jupyter notebook is that you can embed markdown explanations side-by-side with the code. If you do not use markdown in Jupyter, then your code must be accompanied by a second document that describes what it does and how it does it.
<br><br>
There must be example uses of your code, convincing the reader they could and would want to use it. You must also include at least one result and proof. This might be a proof of your algorithm or a proof related to your algorithm.  Please ask questions if you have them.
<br><br>
What follows describes the components I expect. The scores listed are guidelines and adjustments will be made for partial credit between the listed values.

    <b>Code Content</b>
    <br>
    Does your code contain substantive content that pertains to your topic?
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>15pts: The code submitted pertains directly to the topic. The code is substantive and properly reflects the content of the course.</li>
      <li>10pts: The code relates to the topic and the course but there is 1 or 2 small components that are missing that would make the code more applicable or substantive.</li>
      <li>5pts: The code relates to the topic but is not completed at the level of the course.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Code Execution</b>
    <br>
    Does your code work and do what you say it will do?
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>10pts: The code runs cleanly and produces the results expected when tested.</li>
      <li>5pts: The code work correctly in most cases but in some edge cases there are computational errors.</li>
    </ul>

  <td>
    <b>Code Practice</b>
    <br>
    Is your code well-organized with comments and appropriate white space to be understandable.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>5pts: The code is well commented and white space is used appropriately to make the code more readable.</li>
      <li>3pts: There are some comments but the viewer needs to work some steps on their own to understand the content. White space is used to make the code readable.</li>
      <li>1pt: White space is used somewhat appropriately to make the code look presentable, but there are no comments.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Usability</b>
    <br>
    You must include documentation on:
    <ul>
      <li>what language is used and what version is recommended;</li>
      <li>what compiler/IDE is used/recommended.</li>
    </ul>
    How accessible is your code for use? Can I run it on my computer? Of course, some installation or updates might be required. If this is the case, you should include documentation.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>5pts: It is easy to run the code on my computer. If packages or software needs to be installed, then this is well-documented.</li>
      <li>3pts: There is some effort on my part to get the code to run on my computer beyond the documentation provided by the student, resulting from the way the code is written.</li>
    </ul>
  </td>

<tr>
  <td>
    <b>Explanation</b>
    <br>
    Does the documentation for your code describe the purpose of each piece, provide examples, and teach others how to use the code?
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>10pts: Functions have documentation on their input and output. Every function/block of code includes examples of how to use it.</li>
      <li>7pts: All functions are explained. Some functions/blocks of code do not have sufficient examples.</li>
      <li>5pts: There are not examples but the functions are well-documented.</li>
      <li>2pts: Some functions are well-documented.</li>
    </ul>

  <td>
    <b>Statement with Proof</b>
    <br>
    Is there a formal statement of at least one algorithm with proof that the algorithm will provide the result that is expected.
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>10pts: There is a formal statement of at least one algorithm in the code with well-written proof that it completes the indicated task.</li>
      <li>7pts: There is a proof of an algorithm but some of the formality in terms of writing the algorithm or the proof is not complete.</li>
      <li>5pts: This is some statement related indirectly to one of the algorithms in the code and is fully proved. However the connection is not obvious.</li>
      <li>2pts: There is a statement and proof but it does not relate to the code.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Exercises</b>
    <br>
    Are there suggestions of exercises for the user to implement using your code?
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>5pts: There are at least 3 exercises for a user to try to use the code for.</li>
      <li>3pts: There are 2 exercises for a user to try to use the code for.</li>
      <li>2pts: There is 1 exercise for a user to try to use the code for.</li>
      <li>1pt: There are exercises but they do not use the submitted code in their solving.</li>
