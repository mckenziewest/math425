## Task 

Submit a pdf containing the sources you intend to use for your study while 
completing your artifacts as well as some preliminary questions you have about your topic that you will use as guidance while working.

Notes 

* These sources can include YouTube videos and whatever (seemingly reputable) sources you find online.
* Your questions list should include 3-5 questions you have as you start your learning about the topic.  The goal is to have these questions guide your research and in the end you want to answer these questions within your artifacts. 
* You will do a short reflection at the end of the project describing the level at which you were able to answer these questions, and if so where in your artifacts can I find the answers.

## Purpose 

* Verify that you can find videos and/or readings that relate to and describe your topic.
* Verify that you have begun generating initial thoughts about your topic and what it means.
* Help provide you guidance for your studies.

## Criteria

Graded on completion of the task by the deadline. 
Again, I am looking specifically for:

* 3-5 sources on your topic 
* 3-5 questions guiding your research
