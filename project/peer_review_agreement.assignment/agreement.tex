	On April 29, I will submit a draft version of my artifact \underline{\hspace*{2.5in}} to the Canvas assignment titled Artifact Draft. The peer reviewers for this artifact will be 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \underline{\hspace*{2.5in}}, and
			\vskip .25in
			\item \underline{\hspace*{2.5in}}.
		\end{itemize}
	\vskip .25in
	By May 3 at 4pm, I will read and/or watch the artifacts submitted by
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \underline{\hspace*{2.5in}} submitted by \underline{\hspace*{2.5in}}, and
		\vskip .25in
		\item \underline{\hspace*{2.5in}} submitted by \underline{\hspace*{2.5in}}.
	\end{itemize}
	I will then, using the rubric for the given artifact, provide comments on what they have done well and what they can improve before they submit their final version of the artifact. My comments will be thorough and I will provide suggestions for at least two valuable changes they can make to improve and at least two comments on what they should keep. My comments will be shared with each peer by submitting them as peer reviews on the Canvas assignment titled Artifact Draft.
