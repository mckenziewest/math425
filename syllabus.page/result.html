Textbook: Introduction to Abstract Algebra, Fourth Edition, by W. Keith Nicholson</p>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>An introduction to the abstract concepts of algebra such as groups, rings, and fields. Topics such as direct products, group homomorphisms, factor groups, integral domains, and polynomial rings will be included.</p>
<h2>Course Goals</h2>
<p>After the completion of Math 425, students will be able to<br/>
1.  analyze objects and statements using the definitions of groups and rings (e.g., understand why the symmetries of a regular n-sided figure in the plane form a group),<br/>
2.  relate algebraic structures through homomorphisms and isomorphisms (e.g., establish all possible homomorphic maps between two specific groups and understand how these maps can tell you more about one group from your understanding of the other group), <br/>
3.  recognize and apply the special properties of algebraic structures (e.g., principal ideal domains), <br/>
4.  prove or disprove statements using a given list of definitions and theorems, and<br/>
5.  communicate mathematics through written and verbal means. </p>
<h2>Welcoming Environment</h2>
<p>A major component of this course is large group discussion. I ask that you recognize that all of your classmates have different mathematical backgrounds and experiences. Respect one another; give everyone a space to answer a question, to ask a question, to have an idea, and to be wrong.</p>

<h2>Evauation</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This course is going to be graded, in part, using the scheme known as Specs grading. This means that I will share a list of 27 specifications that I expect you to complete for the course. You will be given exercises that correspond to each of the objectives that will be graded as exceptional/satisfactory/unsatisfactory. You will be given many opportunities to complete each of the objectives and improve your marks.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>There are many reasons instructors choose to use specifications grading in their classrooms. Among those reasons are improved learning and interest in the content, more time for student questions, and faster turnaround on grading. The freedom of choice offered by specs grading often results in a moral boost for both the students and the professor. </p>
<h3>Grading Scheme</h3>
<ul>
<li>60% - Completion of Objectives</li>
<li>15% - Completion of Supplemental Exercises</li>
<li>25% - Final Project</li>
</ul>
<h4>Completion of Objectives</h4>
<p>I have specified 27 topics which you are expected to learn in this course. Of these 27, you will need to complete 22 at a level of exceptional or satisfactory. You will be given a homework assignment each week with associated objectives that is due on the following Friday at 4pm to Canvas. Most of the objectives will require you to write a proof. Some will require you to complete a computational assignment using WeBWorK or on paper. As said before, your assignments will be graded on a scale of exceptional/satisfactory/unsatisfactory. </p>
<p>For proof assignments, this grade will be determined by persuasiveness of your argument and proper reference to existing results and definitions. You must reference theorem numbers and definitions from our textbook and notes, and use full sentences and proper grammar to earn a satisfactory or exceptional grade. Succinct proofs that stand out as particularly well-written will earn the mark of exceptional. I will write a good supply of comments on any improvements that can be made so help you improve your mark. On following Wednesdays, you may submit new attempts at any previous unsatisfactory objectives. You will need to complete a different exercise for each attempt at earning a specification.</p>
<p>For computational WeBWorK assignments, your grade will be determined by percentage score and number of attempts. If you do not fully complete the exercise or have a large number of attempts (more than 5) you will earn an unsatisfactory score on the assignment. A new version of the assignment will then be generated for you.</p>
<p>The score you earn for the 60% of your grade that is “completion of specifications” will be (number of objectives passed) / 22. The numerator of this score is capped at 22, so while you’re welcome to complete additional specifications, they will not count toward your grade.</p>
<h4>Completion of Supplemental Exercises</h4>
<p>Each week, you will be presented with about two exercises that do not fit into the list of objectives. These will be graded according to the same scale as the objectives exercises, exceptional/satisfactory/unsatisfactory. Each of the supplemental exercises that you complete at an exceptional level will award you one percentage point toward this 15% of your grade, each that you complete at a satisfactory level will earn you half of a percentage point toward this score. For example, if you complete 7 of these exercises at an exceptional level and complete 12 at the satisfactory level, then you will earn 13% toward your overall grade.   You will not be able to earn more than 15% though this category. You are welcome to rewrite and resubmit any of the additional exercises on which you earn an unsatisfactory grade. Rewrites will be due on Wednesdays via Canvas.</p>
<h4>Final Project</h4>
<p>You will be researching, writing about, and creating a video about a topic related to the course. This portion of the course will be assigned a grade using a standard point-based grading scheme. Rubrics for each task, and additional details will be available when the time comes.</p>
<h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>You are expected to attend class every day. Consistent with university policy, attendance will be taken each class period to ensure you keep your insurance and financial aid.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Students are encouraged not to engage in disruptive use of technology. The use of calculators or mathematical software will be allowed for most homework exercises. You are absolutely not to use resources such as Chegg and StackExchange for homework help or answers. DO NOT GOOGLE THE ANSWERS!</p>
<h2>Health and Safety</h2>
<p>This class will adhere to UWEC COVID-19 policies and guidelines as found here <a href="HTTPS://WWW.UWEC.EDU/CORONAVIRUS-UPDATES/">HTTPS://WWW.UWEC.EDU/CORONAVIRUS-UPDATES/</a>. Each of us shares responsibility for the health and safety of all in the classroom environment.</p>
<p>If you are sick, please stay home and get notes from your classmates. Do not expect that the days lecture will be recorded.</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>You are expected to work together on homework sets, though everyone is required to write up and submit their own solutions, unless otherwise stated. Solutions that appear to be direct copies of a classmate’s or of ones found online will require a one-on-one meeting with me to discuss the source and next steps.</p>
<h2>Make-up Policies</h2>
<p>You are expected to get your homework to Canvas by the deadline each week. If for some reason, you cannot meet that deadline, please get in touch with me, so that we can discuss proper arrangements.<br/>
Due to the nature of specifications grading, you will be expected to turn in repeated attempts at assignments on subsequent Wednesdays.</p>
