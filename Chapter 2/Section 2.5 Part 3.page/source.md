## Outcomes
After class time today you will be able to

* identify the number of homomorphisms that exist from \\(\mathbb{Z}_m\\) to \\(\mathbb{Z}_n\\),
* compute the automorphism group of a small group, and
* prove that \\(\operatorname{Aut}(G)\\) is a group.

## Read 

Section 2.5 Theorem 2 and Example 9
Pages 104-105 (automorphisms)

## Recommended practice

Find as many homomorphisms \\(\mathbb{Z}_6\to\mathbb{Z}_3\\) as you can.
Find all isomorphisms \\(\phi\colon\mathbb{Z}_4\to\mathbb{Z}_4\\).
