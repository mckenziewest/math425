	\begin{block}{Method of Direct Proof.}
		To prove a statement ``if $P$, then $Q$'', we assume $P$ is true and show that $Q$ must then also be true.
		\enumarabic{
			\item Express your statement in the form
				\[\forall x\in D,\ \text{if}\ P(x),\text{ then }Q(x).\]\vskip .5cm
			\item Start the proof by letting $x$ be an arbitrary element of $D$.  Assume $x$ satisfies the condition $P(x)$.\vskip 1cm
			\item Show that $Q(x)$ is true.
		}
	\end{block}
}
\slide{
	\begin{exa}
		Prove that the sum of any two even integers is even.
			\enumarabic{
				\item For all \pause integers $x$ and $y$, if $x$ and $y$ are even, then $x+y$ is even.
			}
			\begin{block}{Proof.}
				Let $x$ and $y$ be integers.  Assume $x$ and $y$ are even.
%			\enumarabic{
%				\item[\textbf{2.}] \pause
%				\item[\textbf{3.}] By the definition of even, there exist integers $r$ and $s$ such that $x=2r$ and $y=2s$.\pause
%				
%				Using basic arithmetic,
%					\[x+y=2r+2s=2(r+s).\]\pause
%				Let $t=r+s$.  Notice that since $r$ and $s$ are integers, so is $t$.  Thus $x+y=2t$ is even by definition.
%			}
		\end{block}
	\end{exa}
}
\slide{
	\begin{block}{Method of Reduction to Cases.}
		\begin{exa}
			Prove that if $n$ is an integer, then $5n^2+n-72$ is even.
		\begin{block}{Proof.}
				Let $n\in \Z$.  We consider two cases: $n$ is even or $n$ is odd.\pause
			\begin{description}
				\item[Case 1.] Assume $n$ is even.  Then there is a $s\in \Z$ such that $n=2s$.  Compute
					\begin{eqnarray*}
					5n^2+n-72 &=& 5(2s)^2+(2s)-72\\
						&=&5(4s^2) + 2s-72\\
						&=&2(10s^2+s-36)
					\end{eqnarray*}
				Since $s$ is an integer, so is $10s^2+s-36$. Thus $5n^2+n-72=2(10s^2+s-36)$ is even by definition whenever $n=2s$ is even.
			\end{description}
		\end{block}
		\end{exa}
	\end{block}
}
\slide{
	\begin{description}
		\item[Case 2.] Assume now that $n$ is odd.  Then there is a $s\in \Z$ such that $n=2s+1$.  Compute
		\begin{eqnarray*}
			5n^2+n-72 &=& 5(2s+1)^2+(2s+1)-72\\
			&=&5(4s^2+4s+1) + 2s-71\\
			&=&20s^2+20s+5+2s-71\\
			&=&2(10s^2+11s-33)
		\end{eqnarray*}
		Since $s$ is an integer, so is $10s^2+11s-33$. Thus $5n^2+n-72=2(10s^2+11s-33)$ is by definition even when $n=2s+1$ is odd.\hfill$\square$
